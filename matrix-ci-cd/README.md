# Matrix Strategy
The matrix strategy in GitHub Actions allows you to run a job multiple times with different parameters. This is particularly useful for testing your code against different environments, such as various versions of programming languages, different operating systems, or different dependency versions. The matrix strategy defines multiple configurations, and GitHub Actions automatically generates and runs a job for each configuration.
